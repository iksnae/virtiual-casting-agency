## Implementation approach

We will utilize Python programming language and leverage open-source libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our architecture will follow a layered approach, separating concerns into distinct components to maintain simplicity and flexibility. We will create a screenplay analysis system that utilizes LLM technology to extract insightful character, location, scene, and dialogue reports as well as other screenplay analysis information. This analysis will be used to augment the production pipeline for providing voice casting services using AWS Polly.

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Main {
        -ScreenplayAnalysis screenplay_analysis
        +main() str
    }
    class ScreenplayAnalysis {
        -NlpEngine nlp_engine
        -CharacterAnalysis character_analysis
LocationAnalysis location_analysis
SceneAnalysis scene_analysis
DialogueAnalysis dialogue_analysis
        +analyze(screenplay: dict) dict
    }
    class NlpEngine {
        -tokenizer tokenizer
        -parser parser
        -generator generator
        +process(input: str) dict
    }
    Main --> ScreenplayAnalysis
    ScreenplayAnalysis --> NlpEngine

## Program call flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant SA as ScreenplayAnalysis
    participant NLP as NlpEngine
    M->>SA: analyze(screenplay)
    SA->>NLP: process(input=screenplay['text'])
    NLP-->>SA: return analysis
    SA-->>M: return screenplay_analysis

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on which open-source libraries to use for NLP tasks.
