{"Implementation approach": "We will utilize Python programming language and leverage open-source libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our architecture will follow a layered approach, separating concerns into distinct components to maintain simplicity and flexibility. We will create a screenplay analysis system that utilizes LLM technology to extract insightful character, location, scene, and dialogue reports as well as other screenplay analysis information. This analysis will be used to augment the production pipeline for providing voice casting services using AWS Polly.", "File list": ["main.py", "screenplay_analysis.py", "voice_casting.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "classDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -ScreenplayAnalysis screenplay_analysis\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class ScreenplayAnalysis {\n        -NlpEngine nlp_engine\n        -CharacterAnalysis character_analysis\nLocationAnalysis location_analysis\nSceneAnalysis scene_analysis\nDialogueAnalysis dialogue_analysis\n        +analyze(screenplay: dict) dict\n    }\n    class NlpEngine {\n        -tokenizer tokenizer\n        -parser parser\n        -generator generator\n        +process(input: str) dict\n    }\n    Main --> ScreenplayAnalysis\n    ScreenplayAnalysis --> NlpEngine", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant SA as ScreenplayAnalysis\n    participant NLP as NlpEngine\n    M->>SA: analyze(screenplay)\n    SA->>NLP: process(input=screenplay['text'])\n    NLP-->>SA: return analysis\n    SA-->>M: return screenplay_analysis", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on which open-source libraries to use for NLP tasks."}
